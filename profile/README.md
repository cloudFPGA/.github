Welcome to **_cloudFPGA_**. This organization hosts a set of repositories and projects related to the [*_cloudFPGA system_*](https://www.zurich.ibm.com/cci/cloudFPGA/), a disaggregated data processing platform based on standalone and network attached FPGAs in the Cloud.

We built the **cloudFPGA (cF)** system because we wanted to research the use and the deployment of 
standalone network-attached FPGAs into the Cloud, but could not find such an off the shelf hardware.

Now that we have a few cF platforms up and running in our on-prem Cloud, we would like to share them 
with the FPGA research community around the world. If you want to experiment or start working with
such a cluster of network-attached FPGAs, please get in touch with us.
